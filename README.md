# Dynamic Dependent DropDown Selection Laravel with AJAX 

##### 1- Dump the database with sql file you provided me .

##### 2- I used the same database name and table 


##### 3- The table Registerations in migration section will Have the records that comes from the Register form 


##### 4- I used 2 Controllers , 1st one DynamicDependentController for fetching the cities and districts and 2nd Controller to save
##### the data comes from the user , with the Controller RegistrationController.

### The Front-end Framework used is "Semantic  ui" , its better that the "Choosen" but simillar functionality !

#### Ajax scripts are located in the Register 'view'
#### Alret and dropdown scripts Located in /public/js/myJs
